# Horoscope Generator
Horoscope generator is a javascript script that will generate a random prediction for your day every time it's run. It asks for name, and uses it in the prediction message.

The script selects randomly between several message templates, and then fills several placeholders inside the template with random words and expressions based on both absurd funny statements and Barnum Effect lines, creating an unique message everytime it runs.
